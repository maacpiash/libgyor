# The client-side application

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.3.1.

## Instructions

Give the following commands to start the client:

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

### Note

- The `npm` commands might require superuser privilege in *nix systems.

- If you do not want to use `npm start`, you can also give command `ng serve --proxy-config proxy.conf.json`, since the project requires cross-origin support.
    - Hence, just giving `ng serve` command might not work properly.
